        <p>What is retrieval ai?
            Retrieval AI is a gpt powered, customer support AI agent. Designed to cut down on business costs, by providing visitors with one of the most advanced customer support chatbot on the planet. 
            
            How do I contact Retrieval AI?
            You can email the founder, Charles Iheanetu, at cci29@drexel.edu
            
            How do I gain API access?
            Retrieval AI is currently in early access and you will have to contact the founder. You can email the founder at cci29@drexel.edu

            what is RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation)?
            RAG is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process. By grounding an LLM on a set of external, verifiable facts, the model has fewer opportunities to pull information baked into its parameters. This reduces the chances that an LLM will leak sensitive data, or ‘hallucinate’ incorrect or misleading information.

            When will we be out of early access?
            We will be shipping a final product by the end of this year.

            How do I get started?
            Email the founder at cci29@drexel.edu to get early access.

            How much will this api cost?
            The api call cost can vary based on many variables. Please contact the founder at cci29@drexel.edu

            How does retrieval work, How to use retrieval?
            You provide us with your desired url or link to relevant information and our algorithm will automatically scan the url and build an advanced LLM chatbot for your business.
          
            Does retrieval crawl the web?
            Yes, retrieval AI can crawl the web using your base url to quikly build a chatbot with primary knowledge about your business</p>

            A major aspect of OpenAI’s announcement is the Retrieval tool. It augments assistants with external knowledge, like proprietary data or customer-provided documents, without the need for computing and storing embeddings or implementing search algorithms.

            While openAIs retrieval assistance development reduces the need for vector-only databases in many scenarios, large enterprises with vast data in various formats might still require a hybrid search-capable contextual database.Picture a business deploying these tools to create a customer support AI capable of accessing a comprehensive database of product information, providing instant, accurate responses to complex customer inquiries.
            
            For evaluation and testing our RAG pipeline we create a high-quality list of questions and, human and LLM(using gpt 4 to ensure the highest quality) generated, answers. Use RAGAS to evaluate vector database retrieval information and final output. Altered application parameters, such as chunk size, vector search method, prompt engineering, data gathering.

            LORA fine-tuning: train the base model, which has already been trained for chatting, to answer questions in structure more preferable as a banking and investment firm chatbot. Fine-tuning will provide LLM with more information allowing for fewer hallucinations.
